# Retinal-OCT-Image-Classification-Using-CNN
This project presents a deep learning solution for automatic classification of retinal diseases from OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) images.

---

##  Overview

We utilize a dataset of 66,788 retinal OCT images categorized into four classes:
- CNV (Choroidal Neovascularization)
- DME (Diabetic Macular Edema)
- Drusen
- Normal

**Our goal** is to build a robust CNN-based model to aid ophthalmologists in early and accurate diagnosis of retinal diseases.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from publicly available OCT scans:
- 66,788 images
- Varying resolutions (128x128 to 192x192)
- Class labels assigned automatically or through image folders

---

## Preprocessing

Two preprocessing strategies were applied:

### Basic Pipeline (Model 1)
- Shuffle image paths
- Label retrieval
- Resize images to (192, 192)
- Batch (64), Prefetch, and Create Datasets

### Enhanced Pipeline (Models 2-5)
- Automatic label assignment
- Standardization
- Class weight calculation
- Optimized data loading (caching)
- Efficient dataset creation

### GAN Trial:
Used resolution enhancement techniques to improve the consistency and quality of input images.
